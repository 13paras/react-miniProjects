# React Mini Projects

Welcome to the React Mini Projects repository! This repository was created to enhance my React skills and to master some of the core concepts of React.js. If you like these projects, you can also learn by creating them yourself from the Projects section and understanding the concepts.


## ðŸ“– Introduction
This repository was created with the aim of enhancing my skills in React.js and mastering its core concepts. Each project in this repository focuses on a different aspect of React, allowing me to gain a comprehensive understanding of this powerful library. If you find these projects interesting, feel free to use them as a reference for your own learning.


## ðŸš€ Getting Started
To get started with these projects, youâ€™ll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-miniProjects

# Go into the repository
$ cd react-miniProjects

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm run dev

```


## ðŸ¤– Projects

Each project is contained within its own component in the ```components``` folder. As I continue to learn and experiment, I will be adding more projects to this repository. Therefore, I have chosen not to list each project individually here, as the list will continue to grow over time.
